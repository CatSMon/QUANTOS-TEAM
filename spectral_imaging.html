                    <h3>Advanced Spectroscopy for Industrial Applications</h3>
                    <p>This research line focuses on the development and deployment of spectroscopy techniques, such as LIBS, Raman, XRF, and Hyperspectral for material characterization in demanding industrial environments. We develop fit-for-purpose systems that integrate spectral imaging, machine vision, and optoelectronic hardware for in-line and at-line monitoring.
                    Our work spans several sectors, including mining, where we’ve developed LIBS systems for ore grading and lithium mapping; batteries, with published methods for lithium quantification in anode-less solid-state cells; cork industry where we created an at-line LIBS imaging system for coating inspection in cork stoppers; and in wood recycling, where we used LIBS to detect hazardous elements like Cr and Pb. These high-throughput systems support the development of modular, multimodal platforms aligned with Industry 4.0 standards.
                    Ongoing and future efforts aim to extend these solutions to the recycling industry and other circular economy applications.

                    <h3>Multimodal Sensing and Data Architectures</h3>
                    <p>This line explores the integration of different spectral techniques using advanced data fusion, machine learning, and knowledge distillation strategies. By combining elemental and molecular information, we develop interpretable models for an easier decision-making process. Our recent work has demonstrated how Raman knowledge distillation can enhance LIBS-based classification in lithium-bearing minerals, and how Fourier-space feature selection or superpixel-based adaptive mapping improve signal efficiency and spatial resolution. Another key development is a multi-condition image fusion algorithm, inspired by HDR imaging, which merges datasets acquired under different excitation conditions to overcome saturation and noise limits, improving classification accuracy in mineral analysis.
                    These architectures support scalable, robust, and explainable pipelines, paving the way for intelligent sensing tools in mining, battery materials, and beyond.

                    <h3>Spectral Imaging and Augmented Reality</h3>
                    <p>This research line investigates the integration of spectral imaging with immersive visualization technologies, creating intuitive platforms for material diagnostics and contextual analysis. Building on LIBS and photogrammetry, we developed a pipeline that merges 2D spectral maps with 3D surface models, allowing for interactive exploration of chemical composition. Our latest work introduces an augmented reality (AR) interface for the HoloLens 2, enabling gesture-based manipulation and real-time analysis of spectral data overlaid on digital representations of real objects. This human-centered approach to spectral imaging enhances data interpretation, facilitates training, and opens pathways for collaborative, multisensory analysis in both research and operational settings.

                    <h3>Photonic and Spectroscopic Tools for Heritage Conservation</h3>
                    <p>This line focuses on developing minimally invasive diagnostic tools for cultural heritage analysis. Our work combines compact LIBS systems with fiber lasers for in situ chemical mapping of historical artifacts. In a recent study, we demonstrated the ability to characterize 18th-century Portuguese tiles using depth-resolved LIBS with minimal damage, supported by validation through XRF. Looking forward, we aim to integrate these techniques with 3D modeling and spectral visualization pipelines to support the documentation and analysis of complex surfaces such as glazed ceramics, papier-mâché sculptures, and other fragile heritage materials. These efforts will contribute to more sustainable restoration practices and enriched cultural storytelling.
